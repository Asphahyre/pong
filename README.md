PONG
==============

Created a Pong in Java with LWJGL. (Cf. http://lwjgl.org/ for documentation.)
The main class is QuadExample.class (please don't ask me why).


WARNING:
I use the Linux LWJGL's libs, so take care to use the LWJGL's libs adapted to your OS (FreeBSD, Linux, Macintosh or, the worst : windows).
